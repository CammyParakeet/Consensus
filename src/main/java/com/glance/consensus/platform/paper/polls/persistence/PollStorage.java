/**
 * Persistence boundary for the Polls system
 *
 * <p>Design principles:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Selections-first:</b> Per-voter selections are the source of truth; tallies are derived</li>
 *   <li><b>Async API:</b> All methods are asynchronous and non-blocking from the caller's perspective</li>
 *   <li><b>Backend-agnostic:</b> Implementations may be FlatFile (JSON) or SQL (Jdbi), chosen by configuration</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Consistency model:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each write method is atomic with respect to its key (e.g, a single voterâ€™s selection set for a poll)</li>
 *   <li>Aggregated tallies returned by this API reflect durable storage at the time of completion</li>
 *   <li>Callers may optimistically update in-memory counts, but should prefer tallies returned from persistence
 *       to avoid drift after restarts</li>
 * </ul>
